ER-DIAGRAM

A completely er-diagram lies in the folder "output".
It can be viewed in a normal browser by index.html as a starting point
The diagram contains info about table, columns an releationship as defined in the database.
The database is kept very simple by purpose. This enables quick changes in the display layer, as this is a display-heavy project :-)
